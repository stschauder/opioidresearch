abstract = {We examine how deaths and emergency department (ED) visits related to use of opioid analgesics (opioids) and other drugs vary with macroeconomic conditions. As the county unemployment rate increases by one percentage point, the opioid death rate per 100,000 rises by 0.19 (3.6{\%}) and the opioid overdose ED visit rate per 100,000 increases by 0.95 (7.0{\%}). Macroeconomic shocks also increase the overall drug death rate, but this increase is driven by rising opioid deaths. Our findings hold when performing a state-level analysis, rather than county-level; are primarily driven by adverse events among whites; and are stable across time periods.},

abstract = {Event study is a powerful tool for analyzing the dynamic effects of policy and other shocks in microeconomics. However, there is little un-derstanding of how to apply this method when individuals or locations experience multiple events in close succession. We explore methods of estimating a multiple event study with Monte Carlo simulations. Allowing multiple event-time dummies to be turned on at once gen-erally produces unbiased estimates, while ignoring subsequent events or duplicating observations to have one observation per individual-event-time create trends in the outcome variable before and after an event that can obscure the effect. We present empirical applications which show that the choice of method can make important differences in practice.},

How health insurance expansions affect young adults through employment and education have important implications for public finance. Since tax data record access to employer-provided fringe benefits on W-2 forms, we are able to examine the impact of this coverage expansion by comparing young adults whose parents have access to benefits to other similar-aged young adults, before and after the law, and to young adults who are slightly older than the age threshold of the law. The use of tax data to identify families who have fringe benefits through their employer is an important advantage because the law was implemented during a labor market recovery in which outcomes could differ by age, even absent the law.

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The Affordable Care Act (ACA) completed its second open enrollment period in February 2015. Assessing the law's effects has major policy implications. OBJECTIVES To estimate national changes in self-reported coverage, access to care, and health during the ACA's first 2 open enrollment periods and to assess differences between low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not expand Medicaid. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of the 2012-2015 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a daily national telephone survey. Using multivariable regression to adjust for pre-ACA trends and sociodemographics, we examined changes in outcomes for the nonelderly US adult population aged 18 through 64 years (nâ€‰=â€‰507,055) since the first open enrollment period began in October 2013. Linear regressions were used to model each outcome as a function of a linear monthly time trend and quarterly indicators. Then, pre-ACA (January 2012-September 2013) and post-ACA (January 2014-March 2015) changes for adults with incomes below 138{\%} of the poverty level in Medicaid expansion states (nâ€‰=â€‰48,905 among 28 states and Washington, DC) vs nonexpansion states (nâ€‰=â€‰37,283 among 22 states) were compared using a differences-in-differences approach. EXPOSURES Beginning of the ACA's first open enrollment period (October 2013). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-reported rates of being uninsured, lacking a personal physician, lacking easy access to medicine, inability to afford needed care, overall health status, and health-related activity limitations. RESULTS Among the 507,055 adults in this survey, pre-ACA trends were significantly worsening for all outcomes. Compared with the pre-ACA trends, by the first quarter of 2015, the adjusted proportions who were uninsured decreased by 7.9 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -9.1 to -6.7); who lacked a personal physician, -3.5 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -4.8 to -2.2); who lacked easy access to medicine, -2.4 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -3.3 to -1.5); who were unable to afford care, -5.5 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -6.7 to -4.2); who reported fair/poor health, -3.4 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -4.6 to -2.2); and the percentage of days with activities limited by health, -1.7 percentage points (95{\%} CI, -2.4 to -0.9). Coverage changes were largest among minorities; for example, the decrease in the uninsured rate was larger among Latino adults (-11.9 percentage points [95{\%} CI, -15.3 to -8.5]) than white adults (-6.1 percentage points [95{\%} CI, -7.3 to -4.8]). Medicaid expansion was associated with significant reductions among low-income adults in the uninsured rate (differences-in-differences estimate, -5.2 percentage points [95{\%} CI, -7.9 to -2.6]), lacking a personal physician (-1.8 percentage points [95{\%} CI, -3.4 to -0.3]), and difficulty accessing medicine (-2.2 percentage points [95{\%} CI, -3.8 to -0.7]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ACA's first 2 open enrollment periods were associated with significantly improved trends in self-reported coverage, access to primary care and medications, affordability, and health. Low-income adults in states that expanded Medicaid reported significant gains in insurance coverage and access compared with adults in states that did not expand Medicaid.},

Since 2010 California, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Washington, D.C., have taken advantage of the law's option to expand coverage earlier to a portion of low-income childless adults. We present new data on these expansions. Using administrative records, we documented that the ramp-up of enrollment was gradual and linear over time in California, Connecticut, and D.C. Enrollment continued to increase steadily for nearly three years in the two states with the earliest expansions. Using survey data on the two earliest expansions, we found strong evidence of increased Medicaid coverage in Connecticut (4.9 percentage points; {\$}{\$}p ) and positive but weaker evidence of increased coverage in D.C. (3.7 percentage points; {\$}{\$}p=$\backslash$mathbf{\{}$\backslash$boldsymbol{\{}0.08{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}). Medicaid enrollment rates were highest among people with health-related limitations.

However, there has been no evidence yet on the policy's effect on access to care, and questions remain about the coverage impact on important subgroups. Using data from two nationally representative surveys, comparing young adults who gained access to dependent coverage to a control group (adults ages 26-34) who were not affected by the new policy, we found sizable coverage gains for adults ages 19-25. The gains continued to grow throughout 2011 (up 6.7 percentage points from September 2010 to September 2011), with the largest gains seen in unmarried adults, nonstudents, and men. Analysis of the timing of the policy impact suggested that early gains in coverage were greatest for people in worse health. We found strong evidence of increased access to care because of the law, with significant reductions in the number of young adults who delayed getting care and in those who did not receive needed care because of cost.},

abstract = {A prior epidemiological study identified a reduction in opioid overdose deaths in US states that legalized medical cannabis (MC). One theory to explain this phenomenon is a potential substitution effect of MC for opioids. This study evaluated whether this substitution effect of MC for opioids also applies to other psychoactive medications. New England dispensary members ( n = 1,513) completed an online survey about their medical history and MC experiences. Among respondents that regularly used opioids, over three-quarters (76.7{\%}) indicated that they reduced their use since they started MC. This was significantly ( p {\textless} 0.0001) greater than the patients that reduced their use of antidepressants (37.6{\%}) or alcohol (42.0{\%}). Approximately two-thirds of patients decreased their use of anti-anxiety (71.8{\%}), migraine (66.7{\%}), and sleep (65.2{\%}) medications following MC which significantly ( p {\textless} 0.0001) exceeded the reduction in antidepressants or alcohol use. The patient's spouse, family, and other friends were more likely to know about their MC use than was their primary care provider. In conclusion, a majority of patients reported using less opioids as well as fewer medications to treat anxiety, migraines, and sleep after initiating MC. A smaller portion used less antidepressants or alcohol. Additional research is needed to corroborate these self-reported, retrospective, cross-sectional findings using other data sources.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades the number of opioid pain relievers sold in the United States rose dramatically. This rise in sales was accompanied by an increase in opioid-related overdose deaths. In response, forty-nine states (all but Missouri) created prescription drug monitoring programs to detect high-risk prescribing and patient behaviors. Our objectives were to determine whether the implementation or particular characteristics of the programs were effective in reducing opioid-related overdose deaths. In adjusted analyses we found that a state's implementation of a program was associated with an average reduction of 1.12 opioid-related overdose deaths per 100,000 population in the year after implementation. Additionally, states whose programs had robust characteristics-including monitoring greater numbers of drugs with abuse potential and updating their data at least weekly-had greater reductions in deaths, compared to states whose programs did not have these characteristics. We estimate that if Missouri adopted a prescription drug monitoring program and other states enhanced their programs with robust features, there would be more than 600 fewer overdose deaths nationwide in 2016, preventing approximately two deaths each day.},

abstract = {Public health authorities have described, with growing alarm, an unprecedented increase in morbidity and mortality associated with use of opioid pain relievers (OPRs). Efforts to address the opioid crisis have focused mainly on reducing nonmedical OPR use. Too often overlooked, however, is the need for preventing and treating opioid addiction, which occurs in both medical and nonmedical OPR users. Overprescribing of OPRs has led to a sharp increase in the prevalence of opioid addiction, which in turn has been associated with a rise in overdose deaths and heroin use. A multifaceted public health approach that utilizes primary, secondary, and tertiary opioid addiction prevention strategies is required to effectively reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality. We describe the scope of this public health crisis, its historical context, contributing factors, and lines of evidence indicating the role of addiction in exacerbating morbidity and mortality, and we provide a framework for interventions to address the epidemic of opioid addiction.},

abstract = {Among the knowledge required by healthcare professionals to manage pain is an understanding of the differences between opioid agents and formulations. As the list of new opioid formulations continues to grow, it is increasingly important that clinicians understand the basic pharmacology of these analgesics and how to calculate equianalgesic doses. Administering an equianalgesic dose increases the likelihood that the transition to another opioid or route will be tolerated without loss of pain control or excessive side effects. Although calculation of equianalgesic doses requires relatively simple mathematical skills, few clinicians are prepared to compute them. The purpose of this article is to provide a basic review of the pharmacology of opioids, explain how to calculate an equianalgesic dose, and briefly describe some of the current controversies of the relative potencies of opioids listed in equianalgesic tables.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We sought to collect and characterize all laws governing the operation of prescription monitoring programs (PMPs), state-level databases that collect patient-specific prescription information, which have been suggested as a tool for reducing prescription drug overdose fatalities. METHODS We utilized a structured legal research protocol to systematically identify, review, and code all PMP statutes and regulations effective from 1998 through 2011. These laws were then abstracted along eleven domains, including reporting provisions, data sharing, and data access. RESULTS PMP characteristics vary greatly among states and across time. We observed an increase in the types and frequency of data required to be reported, the types of individuals permitted to access PMP data, and the percentage of PMPs authorized to proactively identify outlier prescribers and patients. As of 2011, 10 states required PMPs to report suspicious activity to law enforcement, while only 3 required reporting to the patient's physician. None required linkage to drug treatment or required all prescribers to review PMP data before prescribing. Few explicitly address data retention. CONCLUSIONS State PMP laws are heterogeneous and evolving. Future studies of PMP effectiveness should take these variations into account.},

To deter diversion and abuse of controlled substances, most states have implemented electronic prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs). We evaluated the impact of state PDMPs on opioid dispensing.Methods.We acquired data on opioids dispensed in a given quarter of the year for each state and the District of Columbia from 1999 to 2008 from the Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System and converted them to morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs). We used multivariable linear regression modeling with generalized estimating equations to assess the effect of state PDMPs on per-capita dispensing of MMEs.Results.The annual MMEs dispensed per capita increased progressively until 2007 before stabilizing. Adjusting for temporal trends and demographic characteristics, implementation of state PDMPs was associated with a 3{\%} decrease in MMEs dispensed per...},
